# Carson James' Work Day PLanner

## Description

 - The motivation for this project was to create a planner from starter code that was able to receive data and save it in the local storage, display a clock in the header, and when comparing the current time to the time in the planner sections the colors change from grey, green, or red depedning if the section is in the past, present, or future. The problem this solves is that it helped to learn the different API's the web had to offer as well as syntax with those API's. It also helped learning more dynamic html manipulation and how you can create responsive websites. I learned how to better traverse the DOM, use jquery, day.js, and how to use them all together to create this project. 


## Installation

- The steps to install this include beginning with the starter code that was provided. I copied this starter code to my repo. I then edited the HTML, CSS, and javascript to my specifications. This included styling, functions, id's, and classes. Then once i got to a stopping point. Whilst pushing through the duration of the project, doing one final push to get the final code onto the repo. Once everything was on the repo and ready to go, i used GitHub pages to deploy the working website to an active URL website.
